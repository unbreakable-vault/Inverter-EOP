# Inverter-Skew on Genesys-2 (Kintex-7)

**Goal:** Implement two identical 3-inverter chains, drive both with the same stimulus, and measure timing skew (Î”t) between their outputs on an oscilloscope. The optional third output shows `XOR(OUT_A, OUT_B)` so pulse width â‰ˆ |Î”t|.

**Board:** Digilent Genesys-2 (XC7K325T-2FFG900C).

The design implements two parallel 3-inverter chains, both fed by the same `sys_clk`. Their outputs (`OUT_A` and `OUT_B`) are compared directly, and also combined into `OUT_XOR` so that skew appears as short pulses.

## ðŸ“„ Report: Inverter Chain Output Delay Difference

I documented the FPGA experiment on measuring delay differences between two inverter chains routed to different FPGA locations.  
The full report is available here: [Inverter Delay Difference Report](docs/inverter delay difference_report_.pdf).


### Key Highlights

```text
OUT_A:   ____/â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾
OUT_B:   _________/â€¾â€¾â€¾
Î”t:         <---->
XOR:     ___/â€¾â€¾â€¾â€¾\____

```


The XOR pulse width equals the time difference between the two rising edges.

- **Objective:** Measure timing delay difference (Î”t) between outputs `output_A` and `output_B`.
- **Hardware:** Digilent Genesys-2 (Kintex-7 FPGA), Tektronix 2-Series MSO, LeCroy WavePro 254HD.
- **Method:** Two 3-stage inverter chains driven by the same input (`sys_clk`), observed on separate channels (`CH1` and `CH2`).
- **Findings:**  
  - MSO2 (200 MHz): Î”t = 1.418 ns (top-left vs bottom-right) and 2.111 ns (top-left vs top-right).  
  - WavePro 254HD (2.5 GHz): Î”t = 1.819 ns (top-left vs bottom-right) and 2.502 ns (top-left vs top-right).
- **Conclusion:** Floorplanning and output placement significantly affect skew, visible even at nanosecond resolution.
